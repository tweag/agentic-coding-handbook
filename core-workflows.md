# ðŸ”„ Core Workflows

Master the fundamental patterns that make agentic coding effective. These workflows are battle-tested approaches that our teams use daily to deliver high-quality software with AI assistance.

## Essential Workflows

Each workflow addresses a specific challenge in AI-assisted development:

- **Spec-First** - Start with clear specifications before coding
- **Test-Driven Development** - TDD adapted for AI collaboration
- **Memory Bank** - Maintain context across sessions
- **Visual Feedback** - Iterate with visual confirmation
- **Exploratory** - Understand unfamiliar codebases
- **Debug** - Systematic problem-solving with AI
- **Auto Validations** - Automated quality gates

## How to Use These Workflows

1. **Start with Spec-First** for any new feature
2. **Use Memory Bank** for complex, multi-session projects
3. **Apply TDD** when quality is critical
4. **Use Debug Workflow** when things go wrong
5. **Combine workflows** as needed for your specific context

Each workflow includes practical examples, common pitfalls, and step-by-step guidance.
