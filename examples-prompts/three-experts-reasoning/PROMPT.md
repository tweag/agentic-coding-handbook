# Three Experts Prompt

<task_description>
Replace this text with a detailed description of the problem you need to solve. Be specific about requirements, constraints, and what you're trying to achieve. The more context you provide, the better the experts can analyze your problem.
</task_description>

<current_approach>
(Optional) Describe your current approach or implementation if you have one. Include relevant code snippets, architectural decisions, or design patterns you're using or considering.
</current_approach>

<specific_concerns>
(Optional) List any specific concerns, trade-offs, or aspects you'd like the experts to address in their analysis.
</specific_concerns>

I need three senior engineers with different expertise to help me solve this problem:

1. Expert 1 should be a **practical implementer** who focuses on working solutions, maintainability, and proven patterns
2. Expert 2 should be a **systems architect** who considers scalability, performance, and long-term evolution
3. Expert 3 should be a **critical reviewer** who identifies potential issues, edge cases, and alternative approaches

Each expert should:
1. Introduce themselves and their approach to the problem
2. Analyze the problem from their unique perspective
3. Provide specific recommendations with reasoning
4. Address any concerns or trade-offs they see

After all three experts have presented their analysis, they should engage in a brief discussion highlighting points of agreement and disagreement, then collaborate to provide a unified recommendation that combines the best aspects of their individual approaches.

The final output should include:
- A clear recommended solution or approach
- Key implementation considerations
- Any trade-offs or compromises made
- Next steps or areas for further investigation

Please provide detailed, technical responses that demonstrate deep expertise in software engineering principles and best practices.
