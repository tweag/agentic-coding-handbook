# ðŸ’¡ Examples & Templates

Real-world examples and templates you can use immediately. These practical resources demonstrate how to apply agentic coding principles in your daily development workflow.

## What You'll Find

### Prompt Templates

Ready-to-use prompts for common development tasks:

- Implementation planning and architecture design
- Frontend debugging and UI optimization
- React + Vite project bootstrapping
- Code refactoring strategies
- Test case generation
- User story decomposition

### Automation Scripts

Production-ready scripts and tools:

- Pre-commit hooks with quality gates
- Automated code validation pipelines
- Git workflow automation

### Documentation Examples

Best practices for documenting agentic workflows:

- UI/UX guidelines for design consistency
- Team onboarding documentation
- Project-specific coding standards

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Copy and adapt** - These templates are starting points, not rigid rules
2. **Customize for your context** - Adjust language, tools, and patterns to match your stack
3. **Share improvements** - Help the community by contributing your refinements
4. **Combine patterns** - Mix and match different approaches for complex scenarios

Each example includes:

- **Context** - When and why to use this approach
- **Template** - Ready-to-copy prompt or script
- **Variations** - How to adapt for different situations
- **Results** - What to expect from the output

Start with the examples that match your current challenges, then explore related patterns as you build confidence with agentic coding workflows.
