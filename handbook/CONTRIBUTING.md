# Contributing

This handbook is a living document. It reflects what we’ve learned so far about Vibe Coding at enterprise scale — but it’s not finished, and it never will be. We expect it to grow, evolve, and adapt as our team experiments, learns, and discovers better ways to collaborate with AI.

## Why Contributions Matter

- **The handbook evolves with you:** Every week, people across teams are learning new tricks, testing new workflows, and improving results. When you find something that works, document it here.
- **AI changes fast:** New models, features, and tools are launching constantly. What works today might be outdated in six months. Help us keep this handbook current.
- **Your experiments help everyone:** If you test a new prompting pattern, context feeding strategy, or way of organizing specs — document it. Share the knowledge.
- **Enterprise-scale Vibe Coding is still evolving:** We’re all figuring this out together. If you discover better ways to scale across squads or workflows, bring it here.

## Common Contribution Practices

To ensure consistency and collaboration, please follow these best practices:

- **Start small:** You don’t need to write a whole page. A short note, list of learnings, or useful prompt is enough to get started.
- **Use examples:** Real examples (with prompts, outputs, or before/after code) help others replicate what worked.
- **Keep the tone consistent:** Practical, direct, and focused on helping other engineers.
- **Avoid tool-specific bias unless needed:** Focus on transferable practices unless documenting something tool-specific (like Cursor, Copilot, Claude).
- **Group related updates:** If you're updating a section, make sure it's coherent as a whole — not a collection of unrelated edits.
- **Keep it structured:** Use headers, bullets, and short paragraphs to keep the content scannable and reusable.
- **Flag outdated content:** If you’re not sure how to replace old info, comment or tag it as "needs update".
- **Ask for peer review:** Major changes should be reviewed by at least one other engineer before publishing.

## How to Get Started

- Use inline comments in Confluence to suggest changes if you're not ready to write.
- For new ideas or patterns, create a new section or subpage under the most relevant area.
- Add your name or initials next to contributions when appropriate — this helps others follow up with questions.
- Let’s build this handbook the same way we build great products: collaboratively, iteratively, and with care.
