# ðŸ§  Prompt Engineering

Learn to communicate effectively with AI coding agents. Prompt quality was one of the most critical success factors in our experiments - good prompts led to clean, scalable code, while vague prompts caused hallucinations and wasted time.

## Why Prompt Engineering Matters

A prompt is the main way you feed task-level context to AI. Since the model can't guess what you're thinking, it relies entirely on what you say and how you say it.

**Well-crafted prompts:**

- Improve accuracy and consistency
- Reduce hallucinations
- Make AI-generated code easier to validate
- Save time during reviews and rework

## What You'll Master

- **Fundamentals** - Core principles and practical techniques
- **Advanced Methods** - Three Experts, Multiple Iterations reasoning
- **Shot Techniques** - Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting
- **Real Examples** - Templates you can use immediately

## Core Principles

1. **Be specific** - Clear action, expected output, constraints
2. **Provide context** - File names, project structure, dependencies
3. **Break it down** - One focused task per prompt
4. **Iterate** - Refine prompts based on results
5. **Validate** - Always review and test AI output

Think of each prompt like a task you'd hand to a junior developer: detailed but focused, with clear expectations.
