I want you to solve the following problem/task: [DESCRIBE PROBLEM OR TASK HERE]

Your approach should follow these steps:

1. INITIAL SOLUTION: First, provide an initial solution to the problem. Focus on understanding the core requirements and creating a working approach.

2. ANALYSIS ROUND (3-5 iterations):
   For each round (starting with round 1):
   
   a) CRITICALLY ANALYZE your previous solution, identifying:
      - Strengths and what aspects work well
      - Weaknesses, edge cases, and limitations
      - Potential optimizations or improvements
      - Assumptions made and their validity
   
   b) REFINE AND IMPROVE your solution based on this analysis
      - Address the identified weaknesses
      - Implement the optimizations
      - Consider alternative approaches if needed
      - Explicitly note what changes you're making and why

3. FINAL SOLUTION:
   After completing the iterative rounds, provide your final, optimized solution with:
   - A summary of how it evolved through the iterations
   - Key improvements made at each stage
   - Any remaining limitations or considerations

Please label each section clearly (e.g., "INITIAL SOLUTION", "ROUND 1 ANALYSIS", "ROUND 1 REFINEMENT", etc.) to track the evolution of your thinking and solution.
