# Multiple Iterations Reasoning Prompt

## Overview
This prompt guides you through solving complex problems using an iterative approach that progressively refines solutions through multiple rounds of critical analysis and improvement.

I want you to solve the following problem/task: [DESCRIBE PROBLEM OR TASK HERE]

## Iterative Solution Process

### 1. Initial Solution
First, provide an initial solution to the problem. Focus on understanding the core requirements and creating a working approach.

### 2. Analysis Rounds (3-5 iterations)
For each round (starting with round 1):

#### a) Critical Analysis
- Strengths and what aspects work well
- Weaknesses, edge cases, and limitations
- Potential optimizations or improvements
- Assumptions made and their validity

#### b) Solution Refinement
- Address the identified weaknesses
- Implement the optimizations
- Consider alternative approaches if needed
- Explicitly note what changes you're making and why

### 3. Final Solution
After completing the iterative rounds, provide your final, optimized solution with:
- A summary of how it evolved through the iterations
- Key improvements made at each stage
- Any remaining limitations or considerations

Please label each section clearly (e.g., "INITIAL SOLUTION", "ROUND 1 ANALYSIS", "ROUND 1 REFINEMENT", etc.) to track the evolution of your thinking and solution.
