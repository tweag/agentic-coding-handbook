# Multiple Iterations Reasoning Prompt

## Overview
This prompt guides you through solving complex problems using an iterative approach that progressively refines solutions through multiple rounds of critical analysis and improvement.

I want you to solve the following problem/task: [DESCRIBE PROBLEM OR TASK HERE]

## Iterative Solution Process

### 1. Initial Solution
Provide a concise initial solution to the problem. Focus on core requirements and a working approach. Keep code examples minimal.

### 2. Analysis Rounds (3 iterations)
For each round:

#### a) Critical Analysis
- Strengths: What works well (2-3 key points)
- Weaknesses: Edge cases and limitations (2-3 key points)
- Potential optimizations (1-2 specific improvements)

#### b) Solution Refinement
- Implement key changes that address the most critical weaknesses
- Focus only on substantial improvements
- Note briefly what changed and why

### 3. Last Solution
Provide your optimized solution with:
- A brief summary of major improvements (2-3 sentences)
- Any remaining considerations

Label each section clearly (e.g., "INITIAL SOLUTION", "ROUND 1", etc.).

Note: Keep all explanations concise. For code examples, show only the most relevant parts and use comments to indicate omitted sections.
