# Multiple Iterations Reasoning Prompt

## Overview
This prompt template encourages AI systems to solve problems through a structured, iterative approach that mimics how skilled human problem-solvers work. It guides the AI through multiple rounds of solution analysis and refinement, leading to more robust, optimized outcomes.

## How It Works
The prompt follows a three-stage process:
1. **Initial Solution**: The AI creates a first-draft solution based on its understanding of the requirements.
2. **Analysis Rounds** (3-5 iterations): The AI critically evaluates its own work and makes improvements in each round.
3. **Final Solution**: The AI delivers an optimized solution with a summary of its evolution.

## Customization Options

### Adjusting Iteration Depth
- You can specify exactly how many iterations you want (e.g., "Perform exactly 3 analysis rounds")
- For simpler problems, 2-3 iterations may be sufficient
- For complex problems, 4-5 iterations allow for deeper refinement

### Domain-Specific Focus Areas
Depending on your task, you can request focus on specific aspects during analysis:

#### For Code Development:
- Algorithm efficiency and performance optimization
- Code readability and maintainability
- Comprehensive error handling and resilience
- Security considerations and best practices
- Test coverage and edge cases

#### For Writing Tasks:
- Clarity and logical flow
- Supporting evidence and examples
- Tone and audience appropriateness
- Conciseness and impact

#### For Decision-Making:
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Resource allocation efficiency
- Stakeholder impact analysis
- Long-term vs. short-term tradeoffs

## Example Applications
- Developing and optimizing complex algorithms
- Designing robust system architectures
- Creating data processing pipelines with error handling
