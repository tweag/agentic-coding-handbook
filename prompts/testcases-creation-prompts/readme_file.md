## How to Use the Prompt

1. **Copy the Prompt:**  
   Copy the prompt from `testcases_coverage_edgecases.md` into your preferred AI tool or share it with your QA team.

2. **Run the Prompt:**  
   Provide the prompt along with your project context or codebase. The AI or QA engineer will generate a comprehensive set of test cases.

3. **Review Output:**  
   The generated test cases will be saved in a new file named `testcase2.md`. Review this file for completeness.

4. **Expert Review Techniques:**  
   The prompt instructs to apply three expert review techniques (such as boundary value analysis, error guessing, and exploratory testing) and to review the test cases twice. This iterative process helps ensure no scenario is missed.

## Best Practices

- **Provide Context:**  
  When using the prompt, give as much project detail as possible for more relevant test cases.

- **Iterative Improvement:**  
  After the initial test case generation, review and refine the cases using the suggested expert techniques.

- **Collaborate:**  
  Share the `testcase2.md` file with your team for further feedback and improvement.

- **Automate Where Possible:**  
  Consider automating the execution of these test cases to catch regressions early.

## Benefits

- **Improved Coverage:**  
  Ensures all negative, edge, and non-ideal scenarios are tested.

- **Reduced Risk:**  
  Helps catch bugs that might otherwise go unnoticed.

- **Documentation:**  
  Keeps your test cases organized and easy to maintain.
